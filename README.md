# The "Horiseon" website has been updated to meet web accessibilty standards through indexhomework.html.

# This has been done by adding html sematics, html elements now follow a logical structure, all images now have alt attributes, heading attributes fall in sequential order and a concise and discriptive title has been added to the webpage.

# Webpage has been run through a Google Chrome extenstion called 'Accessibility Insights for Web', finding three issues where accessbility standards were not met due to insufficent colour contrasting. An alternative stylesheet has been provided called 'styleaccesschange.css' which does meet accessibilty standards.

# Please look to 'accessibilty test results.png' to understand why there were web accessibilty issues previously.
